# Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ymode/pitop.git

cd pitop

pip install .

cd pittop 

pitop

```
Or if you prefer [pre-release-source](https://github.com/ymode/pitop/releases/tag/v0.3-alpha)
# Help
Pitop [Wiki](https://github.com/ymode/pitop/wiki)

Pitop targets Python 3.11.x however it supports 3.10.x and higher.

In some cases (depending on the OS/distro) the system may not recognise the entry point in setup.py and will not allow the program to be run from the  ``` pitop ``` command.

If this happens you can choose to force pitop to be an executable with the following 

```
cd pitop/pitop
chmod +x pitop.py
pitop

```

Alternatively if you just want to run pitop as a python script

```
cd pitop/pitop
./pitop.py

```

# Future
Pitop remains in active development with a focus on v0.4a-pre-release as the next target. This version will bring better macOS support and feature/widget customisation.
